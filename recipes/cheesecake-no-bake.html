        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>210g <b>cream crackers</b></cream></li>
                    <li>125g <b>butter</b></li>
                    <li>250g <b>cream cheese</b> (left at room temperature)</li>
                    <li>90g <b>icing sugar</b> (<ins>when shopping- buy 130g total</ins>)</li>
                    <li>40g icing sugar (this portion is measured separately)</li>
                    <li>2 <b>eggs</b> (whites only)</li>
                    <li>1 cup <b>water</b></li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons of <b>gelatine powder</b></li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon <b>cream of tartar</b></li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Base</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>To prepare the biscuit base: Blitz/pound cream crackers biscuits into fine crumbs.</li>
                <div>*No blender option: add cream crackers into a clear plastic bag, and use a mug to gently crush the cream crackers into fine crumbs.</div>
                <li>In a saucepan, melt butter on low heat.</li>
                <li>Add cream cracker crumbs into melted butter and mix.</li>
                <li>Pour into a round spring pan (removable base), and press hard on the base to form an even and solid cake base. This is to create a sturdy cake base by removing as much air pockets as possible.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Filling</h3>
            <ol start="5">
                <li>In <ins>Mixing Bowl 1</ins>: Cut cream cheese into small cubes and blend/ electric beat with water and 90g icing sugar.</li>
                <li>Dissolve gelatine powder over a double boil.</li>
                <li>Add dissolved gelatine into cream cheese mixture and blend/ electric beat well.</li> 
                <li>In <ins>Mixing Bowl 2</ins>: Electric beat together egg whites (<b>no yolks</b>), cream of tartar and 40g icing sugar until soft peaks are formed.</li>
                <li>Gently fold/ combine Bowl 2 (egg white mixture) <b>into Bowl 1</b> (cream cheese mixture) using a spoon/ spatula. This should be done gently to preserve the air pockets of the egg white mixture (for that light creamy cheesecake texture). Forcefully combining the egg white mixtures can result in a dense cheesecake texture.</li>
                <li><ins>Spring pan (removable base)</ins>: Gently pour the final mixture into the spring pan containing the cream cracker base.</li>
                <li>Freeze for 4-5 hours (or longer) in freezer until firm.</li>
                <li><b>Finally</b>: Remove cheesecake from spring pan, cut and serve.</li>
            </ol>
